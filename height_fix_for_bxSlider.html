##fixes an issue that time was having 
on while building a site for [Health Environment Art Services](http://www.healtheart.com) were he was using bxSlider to cycle background images.

The issue was occurring when then the viewport was shorter then the total height of the page, resulting in a white box showing up when the page was scrolled down. I assume this is symptom of the bxSlider plugin not having responsive designs in mind.

        auto: true,
        controls: false,

        pager: false
        });

function bgExpander(){
    var aside=$('aside').outerHeight();
  
    if ($(window).height() > aside)
        {var maxHeight= $(document).height(); }
    else  {var maxHeight= aside;}
     
    $('#container, .bx-viewport').height(maxHeight)


    bgExpander();
    $(window).resize(bgExpander);

});
